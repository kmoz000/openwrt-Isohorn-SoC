> **openwrt-DR5322**:

OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead
of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully
writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the
application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you
to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application.
For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having
to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for
full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

Built firmware images are available for many architectures and come with a
package selection to be used as WiFi home router. To quickly find a factory
image usable to migrate from a vendor stock firmware to OpenWrt, try the
